            <h1 className="title">Welcome to Rabbit Hause </h1> 

            <p>We at Rabbit Hause are here to help you with the task of learning a new habit.</p>
            <p>How do we help? Well here at Rabbit Hause, a Habit Rabbit is assigned to your habbit. They act as little assistants to 
                help you remember what is its you're doing and how many days you've done it. Studies show it can take anywhere from 18-256 days to learn a habitr 
                and make it subconscious so the Habbit Rabbit keeps track of whatever goal you have for that habit. How? Well through crunchy carrot treats!ðŸ¥•</p>
            <p> Habit Rabbits LOVE carrots but they are very strick about treat streaks. Make sure you log your days done because even one missed day and the streak resets!</p>
            <p>We hope you enjoy your time with Rabbit Hause and your Habit Rabbits. Remember, its better to start off with one or two at a time. Like rabbits, more than that and it can start
                to get overwhelming.</p>
